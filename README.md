### Companies Using Go
- [How We Moved Our API From Ruby to Go and Saved Our Sanity - Parse](http://blog.parse.com/learn/how-we-moved-our-api-from-ruby-to-go-and-saved-our-sanity/)
> We could downsize our provisioned API server pool by about **90%**. And we were also able to remove silos of isolated Rails API servers from our stack, drastically simplifying our architecture.
>
> As if that weren't enough, the time it takes to run our full integration test suite **dropped from 25 minutes to 2 minutes**, and the time to do a full API server deploy with rolling restarts dropped from **30 minutes to 3 minutes**. The go API server restarts gracefully so no load balancer juggling and prewarming is necessary.
